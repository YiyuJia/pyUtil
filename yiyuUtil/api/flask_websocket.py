# The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web client and a web
# server with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from and
# to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the
# server to send content to the client without being first requested by the
# client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the
# connection open.

# This is a health end point, we can make a GET call to the api and
# the websocket will emit a response that will be visible in the web page.
# To do it, first open a browser and type http://localhost:5000, then in
# a terminal type: curl http://localhost:5000/health. If you go back to
# the browser, you will see that there is a new message that has been sent
# from the server, as a response to the client query in /health end point.
# Note: when using a standard flask end point, we can't use emit directly,
# we need to use socketio.emit.
# More info: https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO/issues/40
# Note 2: if the system is using a namespace, we have to add an extra
# argument to socketio.emit(..., namespace='/test').
