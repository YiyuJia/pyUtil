# Dependency injection:
# Technique where one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.
# The objective is to decouple objects to the extent that no client code has to be changed
# simply because an object it depends on needs to be changed to a different one.
# Dependency injection is one form of the broader technique of inversion of control.
# Theoretically, the client is not allowed to call the injector code; it is the injecting code
# that constructs the services and calls the client to inject them. This means the client code
# does not need to know about the injecting code, just the interfaces. This separates the
# responsibilities of use and construction.
# In Python there are not many frameworks for dependency injection: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2461702/why-is-ioc-di-not-common-in-python
